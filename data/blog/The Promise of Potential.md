Just to get myself back on a two-week schedule, I'll post this today.

I promise this is the last dark post, hahaha. I figure that these establish some of my failures and where I come from, and probably serve as a good backdrop. Hopefully the next posts are just fun, interesting, quirky, and growth-minded.

This is also fairly cocky, but oh well...

I've always been smart.

From a young age, everyone's told me "Oh you're so smart", "You're so bright", and so on. 

And even from a young age, I can't say that that wasn't supported. I never needed to try much, and when I did more, I always succeeded.

Everything came fairly easily to me, I picked up talents and new skills quickly. I grasped difficul things with ease. From learning to sight-read piano, to orienting myself in a new environment, to understanding 2D and 3D NMR, I was never truly out of my depth. 

People have all said I have potential - but to me, I still haven't realized it.

I remember going back to China for the second half of Grade 2. As a little sort of background, even in public elementary schools, the Chinese system requires entrance examinations. I did not test well, being placed in what was probably a third-rate school. But I transfered a few weeks in, and by the end of the year I was one of the top scorers at one of the the top schools in the city.

Even in other things, I tended to be good to great, and mostly without trying.

This pattern continued through high school, and well into university.

However, there were finally people who could beat me.

I didn't have the highest grades, or the most involvement, or the biggest achievements, but I felt fine about it.

I mean, I still did decent. More than decent for most people.

But regardless, I never took the time to be the best. I definitely spent the least time out of anyone who did as well, and I prided myself on that.

I remember some of my friends who worked so hard, and sure they did better. But I was never far behind. I remember thinking, damn, so much time for just that tiny amount? What a waste of time.

Looking back, how wrong I was..

I remember most of my failures, and my successes as well.

I always used to justify my failures with these successes, and with the "certain" knowledge that - if i had tried - they would've been successes too.

But even my successes never involved much trying.

I could list some of my accomplishments here.

41 on the MCAT. 2370 on the SAT. 100th percentile scores, and without much studying. I maybe studied for each for about a week or two, hardly the intensive months-long studying that many use. And I used this to justify my cockiness, my absolute certainty that I was better, that I was smarter, and that I could do whatever.

Even in university, I had a decent GPA (3.85ish). While many of my friends had higher, most studied so much harder, and I noticed. I could always delude myself, that 4.0 wasn't that different from my GPA, that their accomplishments were only a little bit better. In the end, it wouldn't matter, would it?

And maybe I was right, maybe these small changes, individually, wouldn't matter. Maybe if you added them all up, it would. Or maybe, the reason, the why, that these were different - that mattered the most.

I remember getting my final rejection letter from the top US colleges.

I can't even pretend it didn't hurt - it hurt a lot. To my pride, my ego, my confidence, and my belief in myself.

But pretty soon, I was okay with it. I mean, I hadn't tried that hard.

My excuses, I had thought, were all valid. I had skipped Early Action. I had finished on basically the very last day. I hadn't put that much effort into it. And the worst - that it didn't matter that much. Life goes on, right? McGill or Berkeley would be almost just as good, what's the big deal?

And again, maybe these small differences didn't matter - but the attitude behind it did.

Because, three years later, the same thing happened again.

I wavered, I defended my actions, I applied to medical school, but not really trying to, and once again, I was left with a bunch of rejection letters.

And just like my marks, my various accomplishments, applying to jobs, succeeding in relationships, and so forth, not trying kept me safe.

In that little bubble of passivity and self-excusement, I could always maintain the belief that I was fine. It was comfortable, I could do enough, and my worldview would never be challenged, my barriers never be shattered.

I thought that if I never tried, I could keep believing - that when I **did** try, I would easily succeed.

Moments came and passed, and I never could.

I kept waiting for that one moment, that one day, that one dream, that would finally drive me to try and do everything I ever wanted.

Now, I think, I better understand.

Trying and discipline is part of how you become stronger.

I don't think I'd be content, just living life as it is right now. Having a mediocre life, never really stepping outside my comfort zone, is okay. It's comfortable, it's warm - and it's slowly suffocating me.

If I never try, if I never strive, and never give something 110%, I'll never know what it's like to truly succeed, or to truly fail. I'll never live, and I don't think - if I do manage to achieve anything - it'll be as worthwhile.

> Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
> **Calvin Coolidge**

Maybe I'm missing something. A passion, a clear goal, a dream. A realization that this is all I have. An acceptance that my dreams will never find it's way to me - I have to do the searching.

Hence, I'm taking the year to really figure that out.

I will try, to try.

My dream hasn't changed - to change the world.

I know that I might not reach it, but I will try my best to.

With love.

blurb: "Let's hope the future will be better."

For my American friends, before you lash out at what, to many, is a disappointing election result, remember this is the culmination of many problems in the country. Maybe Trump isn't the way to fix them, but for many, he seemed a way.

Let's not wholly label our opponent voters, either on the left or on the right, as monsters and horrible people. There might be a few bad people, but on both sides there's people's lives who have been so affected by recent events, and may be affected in the future.

Hatred will never convince other people people of your own arguments, whatever the merits.

America (and the world) has been so divided, but please, let's try one more time to unite.

If you think the opponent was one of hatred and fear, then please, prove that they were with your love, kindness and trust. Be better, and let's make the world a better place.

With love.
